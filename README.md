## Code Explanation

The application is built using the Express framework and follows a typical MVC architecture. The main entry point (app.js) sets up the Express application, connects to the MongoDB database, and includes the necessary routes.

Middleware functions are defined in middleware.js and handle tasks such as user authentication and error handling. The application's routes are organized into separate files (loginRoutes.js, registerRoutes.js, and logoutRoutes.js) to keep the code modular and maintainable.

The User and Post schemas are defined in UserSchema.js and PostSchema.js, respectively, and are used to model the data stored in the MongoDB database. The posts.js file contains the routes for creating, liking, and retweeting posts.

The front-end is built using Pug templates, which are rendered on the server and sent to the client as HTML. JavaScript files like home.js and common.js handle interactions and dynamic content on the front-end.

Overall, the project demonstrates workflow of a socia media APP like Twitter, allowing users to interact with the platform in a similar manner to the real Twitter website.
